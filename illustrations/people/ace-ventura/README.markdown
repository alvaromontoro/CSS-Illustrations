# Ace Ventura-like caricature in CSS

This is a cartoon done from scratch without a plan on what to do exactly. As the cartoon went, I thought about making it an Ace Ventura-looking cartoon... but instead of histrionic, the expression came up more like an evil James Bond character :S

Credit: the pattern in the t-shirt is a variation of [Lea Verou's Marrakesh CSS pattern](https://leaverou.github.io/css3patterns/#marrakesh).
