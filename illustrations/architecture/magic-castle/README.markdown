# Magic castle

Another castle –the last one for a while, I promise–. This time it is based on [Disney World/Cinderella's Castle](https://dribbble.com/shots/2226079-Disney-World-Cinderella-Castle) by [Dmitry Stolz](https://dribbble.com/dmitrystolz) on Dribbble... and coding this one took more effort than what I expected initially.
