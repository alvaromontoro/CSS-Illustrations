# CSS Hummingbird

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/bGpNreK](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/bGpNreK).

A hummingbird drawn in HTML and CSS using semicircles (although _cheating_ a little bit by stretching and rotating them).

Inspired by the [Ivan Bobrov](https://dribbble.com/bigoodis)'s hummingbirds on Dribbble ([this one](https://dribbble.com/shots/4832273-Bird-Mark) and [this one](https://dribbble.com/shots/4838572-Colibri-mark)).
