# CSS Hummingbird

A hummingbird drawn in HTML and CSS using semicircles (although _cheating_ a little bit by stretching and rotating them).

Inspired by the [Ivan Bobrov](https://dribbble.com/bigoodis)'s hummingbirds on Dribbble ([this one](https://dribbble.com/shots/4832273-Bird-Mark) and [this one](https://dribbble.com/shots/4838572-Colibri-mark)).
