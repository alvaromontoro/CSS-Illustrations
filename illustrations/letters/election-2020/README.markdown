# Election 2020

This was an attempt at doing a simple logo/banner with HTML and CSS. The US presidential elections were 27 days away, and the main candidates were Trump (known for his hair) and Biden (who sports aviator sunglasses).

![The text "election 2020" where one 0 has aviator glasses and the other has Trump's tupe](https://github.com/alvaromontoro/CSS-Illustrations/blob/master/illustrations/letters/election-2020/election-2020.png?raw=true)
